Well done, you made it!


Hoodie is now running a local server.

You are seeing this because your app has no public/ folder.

But don't worry, we're here to get you started!

Get going with Hoodie!

Your first step should be creating a public folder inside your project folder.
Next up, just create your index.html inside that public directory.
We're almost here: Paste this into your index.html just before your closing tag for the body: <script src="hoodie/client.js"></script>
This is necessary for your own javascript files to pick up the hoodie methods. Now handle it just like you would handle your frontend project, hoodie won't get in your way.
Setup your asset folders and create your .css and .js files.
You’ll need to restart the Hoodie server so it servers assets from your app’s public folder
If you want to learn more, check out the documentation (work-in-progress).

Happy coding! 🐶
